# Angulator

A calculator app using Angular components I am designing to practice and build my knowledge of Angular. 

## Description
Implementing Angular components, this app will function just like your standard handheld calculator. A user can enter numbers from the keyboard or using the on-screen keypad, and perform basic mathematic operations. Basic add, subtract, multiply, divide operations (and chaining operations) will be possible, with more operations planned for the future.

## Change Log
10/15/19: Changed input display from number to text type. Added regex to allow only inputs that yield a complete, valid number to display as string in the input field.
10/16/19: Math and clear screen operations working as intended. Will continue to test for edge cases.
